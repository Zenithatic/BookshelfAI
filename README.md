# BookshelfAI

BookshelfAI is an app for anyone, really, but is specifically tailored to book lovers who want an easy way to manage their own list of books. 

Some examples of features include: adding/editing/deleting books from your bookshelf, AI book image recognition, and AI book recommendation.
                    
Disclaimer: this app does not provide any actual book content itself, it only acts as a book manager, not a library. Also, the AI may be inaccurate, especially if your prompts/images are unclear/blurry.
